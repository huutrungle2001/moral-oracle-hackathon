# AGENT ARENA – AI Agent Hackathon

## Introduction
Hosted by **IQAI**, **OpenMind**, and **EwhaChain**, the **AGENT ARENA – AI Agent Hackathon** invites university builders across the globe to create innovative on-chain AI agents. This is a worldwide, fully virtual, 1-month hackathon open to students from any university and recent graduates.

Participants may build using:
*   **IQAI’s ADK-TS** (Agent Development Kit – TypeScript), or
*   **OpenMind’s OM1 platform**

All agents must be launched on **IQAI’s Agent Tokenization Platform (ATP)** after the event to qualify for prizes.

> This hackathon is proudly sponsored by **Frax Finance**, a leader in stablecoin technology, and **KRWQ**, the first digital Korean Won. Judging will be conducted by senior developers and industry experts.

## Tracks
Participants must submit their project under one of the two official tracks:

### 1. ADK-TS Agent
This track focuses on using **IQAI's Agent Development Kit – TypeScript (ADK-TS)** to create full-featured AI agents. These agents are expected to be autonomous, capable of reasoning, planning, and acting. Projects should demonstrate intelligent workflows, unique problem-solving abilities, and practical real-world applications.
*   **Examples:** Research assistant agents, customer support/helpdesk agents with multi-step conversation handling, educational/tutoring agents.

### 2. OM1
In this track, participants utilize **OpenMind's OM1 platform** to build embodied AI agents that can operate in both digital and physical environments. The goal is to showcase how AI can perceive, reason, and interact with the real world.
*   **Examples:** Household robot assistants, social companions powered by large language models like GPT-4o, and educational robots.

## Eligibility
This hackathon is open globally.

**To qualify:**
*   You must be a current university student or a recent graduate (within 3 years).
*   Solo participants and teams of 1–3 members are allowed.
*   All projects must be built from scratch during the hackathon; submissions using pre-existing projects will be disqualified.
*   Multiple submissions are allowed, but only one agent per team will have ATP launch fees sponsored.
*   All valid submissions must be launched on ATP after the hackathon deadline to be eligible for prizes.
*   Prizes are paid in stablecoins (USDC/USDT) — winners must provide a valid wallet address.
*   Valid proof of enrollment or graduation is required to claim prizes.
*   Entries without valid student verification are not eligible for prizes (though they may still be considered for investment).

## Submission Requirements
Participants must submit their project under one of the official hackathon tracks. Submissions will be evaluated against the judging criteria within their track. 3 overall winners will be chosen, along with 1 MVP per track.

**Each submission must include:**
1.  Public GitHub repository with full source code.
2.  Demo video (max 5 minutes) clearly showing how the agent works.
3.  Explanation of how you used ADK-TS or OM1 specifically for this hackathon.
4.  A live demo link so judges can test the agent.
5.  Any additional relevant links (documentation, mockups, etc.).

> **Note:** Late submissions will not be accepted.

## Launching Your Agent on ATP
After submitting your build, all teams with successful submissions will receive an IQ airdrop to cover the costs of hosting and launching their agent on IQAI’s Agent Tokenization Platform (ATP).

To remain eligible for judging and prizes, your agent **must be launched on ATP by December 12, 2025** (three days after the submission deadline). Your final ATP agent link must be included in your submission or added before the ATP launch deadline.
